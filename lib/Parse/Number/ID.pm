=head1 NAME

Parse::Number::ID - Parse number from Indonesian text

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.07 of Parse::Number::ID (from Perl distribution Parse-Number-ID), released on 2014-10-03.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Parse::Number::ID qw(parse_number_id);

 my @a = map {parse_number_id(text=>$_)}
     ("12.345,67", "-1,2e3", "x123", "1.23");
 # @a = (12345.67, -1200, undef, 1.23)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The goal of this module is to parse/extract numbers commonly found in Indonesian
text. It currently parses numbers according to Indonesian rule of decimal- and
thousand separators ("," and "." respectively) I<as well as> English ("." and
","), since English numbers are more widespread and sometimes mixed within.

 12.3     # 12.3
 12.34    # 12.34
 12.345   # 12345

In the future this module might also parse fractions (e.g. 1/3, 2 1/2) and
percentages (e.g. 1,2%).

This module does not parse numbers that are written as Indonesian words, e.g.
"seratus dua puluh tiga" (123). See L<Lingua::ID::Words2Nums> and
L<Regexp::ID::NumVerbage> for that.

=head1 VARIABLES

None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

=head2 $Pat (regex)

A regex for quickly matching/extracting number from text. It's not 100% perfect
(the extracted number might not be valid), but it's simple and fast.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

None of the functions are exported by default, but they are exportable.


=head2 parse_number_id(%args) -> any

Parse number from Indonesian text.

Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

=over 4

=item * B<text>* => I<str>

The input text that contains number.

=back

Return value:

 (any)

=head1 FAQ

=head2 How does this module differ from other number-parsing modules?

This module uses a single regex and provides the regex for you to use. Other
modules might be more accurate and/or faster. But this module is pretty fast.

Also, since English text are often found in Indonesian text, parsing English
numbers (which uses periods for decimals and commas for thousand separators
instead of the other way around) is also done, as long as it is not ambiguous.
