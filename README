NAME
    Parse::Number::ID - Parse number from Indonesian text

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
     use Parse::Number::ID qw(parse_number_id);

     my @a = map {parse_number_id(text=>$_)}
         ("12.345,67", "-1,2e3", "x123", "1.23");
     # @a = [12345.67, -1200, undef, 1.23]

DESCRIPTION
    This module parses numbers from text, according to Indonesian rule of
    decimal- and thousand separators ("," and "." respectively, while
    English uses "." and ","). Since English numbers are more widespread, it
    will be parsed too whenever unambiguous, e.g.:

     12.3     # 12.3
     12.34    # 12.34
     12.345   # 12345

    This module does not parse numbers that are written as Indonesian words,
    e.g. "seratus dua puluh tiga" (123). See Lingua::ID::Words2Nums for
    that.

    None of the functions are exported by default, but they are exportable.
