NAME
    Parse::Number::ID - Parse number from Indonesian text

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
     use Parse::Number::ID qw(parse_number_id);

     my $num = parse_number_id(text=>"12.345,67"); # 12345.67

DESCRIPTION
    This module parses numbers from text, according to Indonesian rule of
    decimal- and thousand separators ("," and "." respectively, while
    English uses "." and "," respectively). Since English numbers are more
    widespread, it will be parsed to whenever unambiguous, e.g.:

     12.3     # 12.3
     12.34    # 12.34
     12.345   # 12345

    This module does not parse numbers that are written as Indonesian words,
    e.g. "seratus dua puluh tiga" (123). See Lingua::ID::Words2Nums for
    that.
