NAME
    Parse::Number::ID - Parse number from Indonesian text

VERSION
    version 0.05

SYNOPSIS
     use Parse::Number::ID qw(parse_number_id);

     my @a = map {parse_number_id(text=>$_)}
         ("12.345,67", "-1,2e3", "x123", "1.23");
     # @a = (12345.67, -1200, undef, 1.23)

DESCRIPTION
    This module parses numbers from text, according to Indonesian rule of
    decimal- and thousand separators ("," and "." respectively, while
    English uses "." and ","). Since English numbers are more widespread, it
    will be parsed too whenever unambiguous, e.g.:

     12.3     # 12.3
     12.34    # 12.34
     12.345   # 12345

    This module does not parse numbers that are written as Indonesian words,
    e.g. "seratus dua puluh tiga" (123). See Lingua::ID::Words2Nums for
    that.

VARIABLES
    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

  $Pat (REGEX)
    A regex for quickly matching/extracting number from text. It's not 100%
    perfect (the extracted number might not be valid), but it's simple and
    fast.

FUNCTIONS
    None of the functions are exported by default, but they are exportable.

    message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third element (result) is optional,
    the actual result. Fourth element (meta) is called result metadata and
    is optional, a hash that contains extra information.
