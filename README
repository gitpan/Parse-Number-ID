NAME
    Parse::Number::ID - Parse number from Indonesian text

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.06 of Parse::Number::ID (from Perl
    distribution Parse-Number-ID), released on 2014-09-28.

SYNOPSIS
     use Parse::Number::ID qw(parse_number_id);

     my @a = map {parse_number_id(text=>$_)}
         ("12.345,67", "-1,2e3", "x123", "1.23");
     # @a = (12345.67, -1200, undef, 1.23)

DESCRIPTION
    The goal of this module is to parse/extract numbers commonly found in
    Indonesian text. It currently parses numbers according to Indonesian
    rule of decimal- and thousand separators ("," and "." respectively) *as
    well as* English ("." and ","), since English numbers are more
    widespread and sometimes mixed within.

     12.3     # 12.3
     12.34    # 12.34
     12.345   # 12345

    In the future this module might also parse fractions (e.g. 1/3, 2 1/2)
    and percentages (e.g. 1,2%).

    This module does not parse numbers that are written as Indonesian words,
    e.g. "seratus dua puluh tiga" (123). See Lingua::ID::Words2Nums for
    that.

VARIABLES
    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

  $Pat (REGEX)
    A regex for quickly matching/extracting number from text. It's not 100%
    perfect (the extracted number might not be valid), but it's simple and
    fast.

FUNCTIONS
    None of the functions are exported by default, but they are exportable.

  parse_number_id(%args) -> any
    Parse number from Indonesian text.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   text* => *str*

        The input text that contains number.

    Return value:

     (any)

FAQ
  How does this module differ from other number-parsing modules?
    This module uses a single regex and provides the regex for you to use.
    Other modules might be more accurate and/or faster. But this module is
    pretty fast.

    Also, since English text are often found in Indonesian text, parsing
    English numbers (which uses periods for decimals and commas for thousand
    separators instead of the other way around) is also done, as long as it
    is not ambiguous.
